The aim of this assignment was to build four different types of classifiers and evaluate their performance. The classification task is to predict whether a tumour is malignant (M) or benign (B).
Using sklearn, the following classifiers were built
- a nearest neighbours classifier
- a decision tree classifier
- a support vector machine classifier
- a neural network classifier
