# Tumour-ML-Classifier

## Description
The aim of this assignment was to build four different types of classifiers and evaluate their performance. The classification task is to predict whether a tumour is malignant (M) or benign (B).
Using sklearn, the following classifiers were built
- a nearest neighbours classifier
- a decision tree classifier
- a support vector machine classifier
- a neural network classifier

## Dataset
The records are stored in a text file named “medical_records.data”. Each row corresponds to a patient record. The diagnosis is the attribute predicted. In this dataset, the diagnosis is the second field and is either B (benign) or M (malignant). There are 32 attributes in total (ID, diagnosis, and 30 real-valued input features).
